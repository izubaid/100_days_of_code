Printing basics
String manipulation 
-	Adding a new line /n
-	Concatenating (use + to do it)
Input Function
-	Input(“ “)
example
# we are using input function below which will prompt the user to enter the name and we are also concatenating the user input with hello
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")

Variables:

# print(len(input("what is your name? ")))

username = input("what is your name? ")
length = len(username)
print(length)

Creating a new variable, calculating the length of the charac from user input

Variables naming
Learn the rules of variable naming in Python.
1.	Make sure your variable names are descriptive
2.	Don't have spaces between words
3.	Don't start with numbers
4.	Don't use special words like print or input
5.	Choose simple words that are less likely to become typos
6.	Check the company style guidelines if you start work at a company

Completed by creating a program for generating band name.

print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in? \n")
# print(city)
pet_name = input("What's your pet's name? \n")
# print(pet_name)
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet_name + ".")
